<ol type="1">
<li>This is an open contest. Anyone may participate in ICFP Programming
Contest 2025 except for the ICFP 2025 Contest organisers.</li>
<li>No advance registration or entry fee is required.</li>
<li>Contestants are free to organise themselves into teams of any size.
A contestant may only be a member of a single team. Teams may not
divide, merge, or collaborate after the start of the contest.</li>
<li>Teams are free to use any programming language(s) on any
platform(s).</li>
<li>Teams must register shortly before or during the contest to obtain
credentials. Teams using more than one set of credentials during the
contest may be disqualified.</li>
<li>Teams wishing to be considered for prizes must submit source code at
the end of the contest. The exact details of contest submissions will be
announced at the start of the contest. Teams may submit multiple times
during the contest, and their best scores will be shown on the live
scoreboard.</li>
<li>To keep the end result hidden until the ICFP conference, part the
live scoreboard will be frozen near the end of the lightning round and
near the end of the complete contest. Specifically, from 22 to 26 hours
into the contest and from 70 hours into the contest (so 2 hours around
the relevant moments), the scoreboards will not be updated.</li>
<li>The Organisers retain the right to monitor, record, and investigate
the submissions, other contest-related activities, or lack thereof, of
contestants and teams. The records are used for the sole purpose of
judgment and are discarded once the contest-related events are
over.</li>
<li>Contestants are kindly asked not to attempt to attack the contest
server. That will spoil the fun for the other teams and the Organisers,
who worked hard to bring you this experience. Violations of these rules,
attempts to compromise the integrity of the contest infrastructure,
attempts to interfere with other contestants, collusion between the
teams, or attempts to contravene the spirit of the contest will lead to
disqualification of the involved contestants and/or teams.</li>
<li>Contestants retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in
and to any submitted solutions, source code, custom tools, and related
materials (“Submissions”) that contestants had before submission. As a
condition of submission, contestants grant the Organisers a
non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license
to use, reproduce, publish, distribute, publicly perform and publicly
display the Submissions, allowing the Organisers to test and evaluate
the Submissions for purposes of the contest.</li>
<li>All decisions of the Organisers are final.</li>
